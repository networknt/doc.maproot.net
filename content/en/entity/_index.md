For each registered user, you can create an entity on the city map with your geolocation. During the entity registration, you can select a category and subcategory along with latitude and longitude. 

Please be aware that you can change the latitude and longitude at any time to adjust your exact location on the map. However, if you change the category or subcategory, then the website or status associated with the entity will be removed. 

Here is video walkthrough on creating an entity.
