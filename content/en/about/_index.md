I am the owner of the light-4j, which is one of the fastest microservices platforms in the world. It supports millions of requests per second with only several millisecond response time. The platform is used by banking, insurance, healthcare, and other industry on production for years. 

Our development team has been focusing on the light-portal and other infrastructure services since late last year. With the global pandemic and lockdown in early April, our team has switched focus to build an application to help people impacted by COVID-19. 

The initial thought was to build a site for people to find help in the neighborhood and to allow retailers to update their status to enforce social distancing. For example, if you are self-isolated at home, you can ask a neighbor to buy groceries and drop at your door. If you are a retailer, you can constantly update the waiting time to avoid a long line at your store. 

We published a demo site two weeks ago and got a lot of feedback from the community. We made the change to the app to allow users to generate and run a website within minutes based on the geolocation and interact with users with dynamic status updates and private messages. 

Now, the production maproot.net is alive with coverage in the US and Canada. The domain name means everyone is connected under the map, just like plant roots form an invisible net underground. 

I hope this site helps people who suffer during this economic downturn and allows us to demonstrate the productivity and scalability of the light-platform.
