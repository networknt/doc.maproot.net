Many cities are in a locked-down mode for a couple of months already, and most people want to go outside to enjoy their favorite restaurants, but the risk is too high to eat out these days. 

* It is dangerous to eat inside a restaurant as a contained environment.
* It is not a good idea to exchange cash or credit card as it can spread the virus. 
* The printed restaurant menus can spread the virus from customers to customers. 
* For fast-food restaurants, order by a person can potentially violate social distance. 

The restaurant application allows customers to order and pay online and pick up at the door or counter to reduce the risk and enforce the social distance. 

A video walkthrough.
