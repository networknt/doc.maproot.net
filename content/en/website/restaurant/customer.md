Many cities are in a locked-down mode for a couple of months already, and most people want to go outside to enjoy their favorite food, but the risk is too high to eat out these days. 

* It is dangerous to eat inside a restaurant as a contained environment.
* It is not a good idea to exchange cash or credit card as it can spread the virus. 
* The printed restaurant menus can spread the virus from customers to customers. 
* For fast-food restaurants, order by a person can potentially violate social distance. 

The restaurant application allows customers to order and pay online and pick up at the door or counter to reduce the risk and enforce the social distance. When the risk is lower enough, customers can order at the table by scanning a QR Code on the table and placing the order. 

Here is an example QR Code that you can scan to test from a restaurant table number 2. Of course, you can also find the restaurant from the map search or bookmark the restaurant in your browser.
