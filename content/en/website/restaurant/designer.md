For most restaurant owners, they are not tech-savvy. Although it is straightforward to enter the menu data into the system, taking pictures and setting up the payment options might be hard for most people. If you are a web designer, please contact us to start your consulting business. If restaurant owners need help, we will let them contact you for assistance, and you can charge them a service fee to bring their menus online.
