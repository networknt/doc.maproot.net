For most restaurant owners, they are not tech-savvy. Although it is straightforward to enter the menu data into the system, taking pictures and setting up the payment options might be hard for most people. If you are a web designer, please contact us to start your consulting business. We charge restaurants a 2 percent fee, and we want to pay designers up to 1 percent for one year if you help restaurants to bring their menu online. 

For anyone who recommends the application to a restaurant owner, once the restaurant menu is online, we pay 0.1 percent for the first three months. For operation detailed, please discuss with us.
