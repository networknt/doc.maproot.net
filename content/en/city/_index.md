All information published on the site is geolocation-based, so it is essential to register your country, province, and city during the user signup process. 

We have populated most provinces and states in Canada and the US as a starting point. If your city is not shown up in the dropdown, you can select the capital city of your province or state. You can always change the city later once your city is populated in our reference API. 

For most users, if they don't want to publish anything on the map, it is not necessary to register the location information during the user registration. However, if you want to create an entity on the map in order to filter based on the location, you need to provide your country, province or state, and city in the profile. If it is not done during the registration, you can update the location info anytime after login from the user profile menu. 

The following is a video walkthrough on city registration during sign up and update in the user profile.
